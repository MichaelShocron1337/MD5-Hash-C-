# MD5-Hash-C-
Implementing a program where the user gets to sign in and the password gets salted + hashed (MD5). Writing to file (database) existning users and hashing their passwords. Used a single file since making several different files didn't make sense because of the size of the program (<500 lines). 

Challenges:
Writing to file, applying ifstream and ofstream for the first time, understanding how hash works and how to create randomized strings.
